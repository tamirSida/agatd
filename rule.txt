 I've made several important changes to fix the notification issues:

  1. Updated Firestore Security Rules:
    - Modified the client notification creation rule to explicitly include the senderId check, ensuring clients can only create notifications for their own orders but can
  now create them for any recipient (including admins).
    - This ensures that the security rules properly allow client users to create notifications for admin users.
  2. Improved Client-Side Notification Creation:
    - Modified the createOrderNotification function in shopping-cart.html to create notifications individually instead of using batch operations.
    - Added better error handling with Promise.allSettled to ensure that if one notification fails, others can still succeed.
    - Added more detailed logging to diagnose issues.
  3. Enhanced Server-Side Notification Creation:
    - Updated the submitOrder function in firebase-config.js to also create notifications individually instead of using batch operations.
    - Added more robust error handling for each individual notification creation.
    - Added comprehensive logging for debugging.
  4. Improved Resilience:
    - Both client and server notification creation now handle errors gracefully.
    - If creation of one notification fails, it won't prevent other notifications from being created.
    - Added detailed logging to help diagnose any remaining issues.

  These changes should resolve the Missing or insufficient permissions error when creating notifications for admin users by:

  1. Ensuring security rules allow clients to create notifications for any recipient
  2. Creating notifications individually rather than in batches
  3. Adding better error handling and reporting

  The system now tries both the client-side and server-side notification creation to maximize the chance of success, and either approach should work with the updated
  security rules.
